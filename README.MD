1. Familiarize with API Page - https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html

2. Implement at least 5 test scenarios using one of JS libraries like Axios, Got, SuperTest:

Example:

· Get Ids using different filters

· create a booking flow (create, read, update, delete)

Try to cover at least two for each method.

Use Basic authorization in headers.

3. Add assertions for response headers, response time, status code, response body and schema (can use npm joi library).

4. Add script into package.json to run API tests through the CLI

5. Push API tests to the remote repository and create a Merge Request

Evaluation criteria (pass rate is 70%)

Here’s the list of actions which result in reduction of overall mark for a completed task:

1. Less than 3 tests implemented (-20%)

2. Not all mentioned assertions were used (-10%)

3. Script to run API test through the CLI was not added (-10%)

4. Small mistakes in code (-10%)
